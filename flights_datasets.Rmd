## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
set.seed(141)
m <- 9
groups <- sample(seq_len(m), nrow(flights), replace = TRUE)
dir.create("flights/", showWarnings = FALSE)
for (i in seq_len(m)) {
  write_csv(filter(flights, groups == i), str_c("flights/", i, ".csv"))
}
```
